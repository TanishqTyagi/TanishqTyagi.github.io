            <p>Hey! My name is Tanishq and I am a 17 year old high schooler who goes to Mountain House High School in

            <p>Here are some fun facts about me!</p>
            <li><b>I enjoy playing tennis.</b> I am currently a part of my school's Varsity Tennis Team, but I also
                enjoy playing recreationally in my free time.</li>
            <li><b>I have great interest in cars.</b> I have always had interest in supercars as well as normal luxury
                and sports cars. However, as time has gone on, my interest in the field always made me want to learn the
                trade of being a mechanic.</li>

                <h2>The Youth Action Committee</h2>
                <p>I have been in a leadership position of the Youth Action Committee, which is a government funded nonprofit
                    organization that is funded by our local community service district, since the beginning of my

                    <li><b>2021 Youth Action Committee Holiday Party</b> 30+ attendees in which we hosted a event in our
                        local town hall to advertise the Youth Action Committee as well as to provide the community with
                        a fun event to relax during the holiday season!</li>
                    <li><b>2022 Summer Program</b> 40+ attendees in which we provided little kids between K-8th grades
                        to be engaged with our local fire department and police department. Additionally made to provide
                        children with a fun activity to fill up a portion of their summer.</li>
                    <li><b>2022 Slack Campaign  </b> Campaign led by me and other council members in which we advocated
                        for the use of a communication platofrm known as Slack for external communication to better plan
                        events outside of monthly meetings. Consisted of various meetings and presentations between the
                        CSD and YAC</li>
                    <li><b>2022 Holiday Party</b> 60+ attendees, similar to last years Holiday Party except with a much
                        more significant turnout.</li>
                    <li><b>2023 Holi Event Advertising</b> Advertised the Youth Action Committee during the local Indian
                        Holi event in front of over 600 people.</li>
                    <li><b>2021-2023 Yacademics Program</b> for around 2 years, me and the other council members
                        organized a volunteering system in which high schoolers can tutor kids K-8 at our local library.
                        With hundreds of children coming to the Yacademics program throughout the season, it provided
                        many high schoolers with volunteering opportunities while helping children who need extra help
                        at no cost.</li>

                <h2>Tennis</h2>
                <p>I have been playing tennis since 4th grade. However, I have only recently begun playing for my high
                school tennis team since the Spring Season of 2023. I mostly play doubles, and our team is known as the 5
                year undefeated reigning champions of the Western Athletic Conference. This year, we played Divison 2
                playoffs and made it all the way to finals where we were finally defeated for the first time 8-1.</p>
